   I just re-read the introduction to GitHub explaining what it is.  You know, the one with the "Hello World" project.  This master will not have have any edits so I will just commit to it and open a pull request.  I guess it is my goal setting document.  The experts say if one is to go out and try to complete anything of substance, it should be in writing.  Well, this is me getting my goals written down.
   
   I have studied web design, both front-end and back-end for years, but have never been able to make it to the finish line.  I am here to declare to the world that this time, I will make it.  I have always been interested in the language(s) that run the internet and this time I am sticking to it until I can make a career change.  My life has become stagnant and I am bored with my career and I think it's time to make a change.  
   
   I am currently learning (or re-learning depending how you want to look at it) web design via https://freecodecamp.org.  GitHub is the repository they want us to put our project in.  I will complete all 6 of their individual certifications in order to claim their "Full Stack Developer Certification".  If anyone has a better website from which I can learn and has a more recognized certification program, your advise would be greatly appreciated.
   
   If at the end of their program, I still fail to make my career change, I plan on enrolling in one of the of the available coding bootcamps.  I know they cost a bit much, but what is a guy to do.  I'm already well into my 40s and I need to get employer's attentions.  But I don't think I will need to go that far.  The projects I will display on here will dazzle and impress.
   
   Well, that is all I wanted to get out of my chest right now.  I guess in the future, everytime I make changes to this document, commit, and ask for pull requests would be when I have completed one of the 7 certifications available on freecodecamp.org.  'Til the next time, I wish you all the best.
